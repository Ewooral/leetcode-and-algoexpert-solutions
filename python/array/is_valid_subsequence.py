VALIDATE SUBSEQUENCE 
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that
determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the 
first one. 
A SUBSEQUENCE of an array is a set of numbers that aren't 
necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same 
order as they appear in the array. For instance, the numbers[1, 3, 4]
form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], and so do the numbers [2, 4]
